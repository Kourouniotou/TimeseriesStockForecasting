# TimeseriesStockForecasting

In the current project, we implemented a time-series forecasting technique that
utilizes previous data of the stock price to predict future ones.
In particular, we used the previous data for the "opening" stock price feature
in order to forecast the next 30 values of this attribute. The model that we used was the LSTM.
